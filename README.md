- **Best Answer Recognition**: Question posters can mark the best answer given by employees, promoting recognition and acknowledgment.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard is available to showcase top-scoring employees based on their contributions and engagement.

## Getting Started

As this project is described for documentation purposes and you have no code to share, consider these conceptual steps to envision the implementation:

1. Design the user interface for the IDEATHON platform using ReactJs.
2. Set up a MSSQLServer database schema to store challenge data, user answers, upvotes, and leaderboard scores.
3. Implement frontend components for posting challenges, answering questions, upvoting, and managing the leaderboard.
4. Simulate interactions and functionality within the platform to reflect employer-employee engagement and recognition.
5. Iterate and refine the platform based on user feedback and company needs.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJs: Frontend development for interactive user interface.
- MSSQLServer: Database management for storing and retrieving data.
- Other technologies may be used depending on the specific implementation within your company.

## Contributing

As this project is specific to your company and currently conceptual, contributions may be limited to internal teams or designated developers. Feedback, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome to enhance the IDEATHON platform.
